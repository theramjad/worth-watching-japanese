# Worth Watching - YouTube Japanese Comprehension Analyzer
# Cursor IDE Rules and Coding Standards

## Console Logging Standards
- **ALWAYS** prefix console.log statements with `[JCA]` for this project
- Example: `console.log('[JCA] Message here');`
- This helps filter extension logs in browser console
- Apply to ALL JavaScript files in chrome-extension/ directory

## Code Organization
- Keep MeCab API server in `/mecab-api-server/` 
- Keep Chrome extension code in `/chrome-extension/`
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names

## Chrome Extension Structure
- `content/` - Content scripts that run on YouTube pages
- `lib/` - Utility libraries and API handlers  
- `popup/` - Extension popup interface
- `background/` - Service worker scripts
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration

## API Standards
- MeCab server runs on localhost:9002
- All video analysis uses POST requests with CSV data
- Health check endpoint returns `mecab_working` field
- Always handle API errors gracefully

## Video Analysis Rules
- Extension works on: home, search, playlist, watch later pages  
- Skip analysis on: watch pages, playlist directories, feed pages (except watch later)
- Use rate limiting for API requests
- Cache comprehension scores to avoid duplicate analysis
